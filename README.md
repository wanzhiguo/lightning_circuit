This simple SNARK application was made in response to a lightning-dev forum post, https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-November/000309.html where AJ Towns suggested using SNARKs to implement a variant of the lightning protocol. The exact application doesn't matter too much, but in the thread there was an initial attempt at benchmarking, which seemed to suggest ridiculous numbers, like 100+MB for a proof about a single hash. So, this project was made to set the record straight about what performance could be expected.

This is a SNARK implementation using libsnark for the following:

``ZkPoK{ (R1, R2): H1 = sha256(R1) and H2 = sha256(R2) and R1 = R2 ^ X }``

Read: given `H1`, `H2`, and `X`, prove you know `R1` and `R2` such that `R1` is the preimage of `H1`,
`R2` is the preimage of `H2`, and `R1` is `R2 xor X`.

# Notes on getting it running.  --Zhiguo Wan

1. run get-libsnark to git pull libsnark from github.com, **prepare-depends.sh not found error appears, just ignore it**.
2. checkout the version when lightning\_circuit was generated.
``cd depsrc/libsnark/ && git checkout 746ade7ce0f30a6f6e612e50450294c8e7ade9a4`` **prepare-depends.sh appears!**
3. Comment ``git pull`` in get-libsnark 
4. run get-libsnark again
5. ``make && .\test``

## performance

on my computer (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770S CPU @ 3.10GHz):

* **key generation time**: 11.6551s
* **proof generation time**: 3.0884s
* **verification time**: 0.0262s
* **proof size**: 2294 bits
* **proving key size**: 102284136 bits
* **verifying key size**: 4586 bits
* **R1CS constraints**: 56101 (mostly sha256-related)

## howto

``./get-libsnark && make && ./test``

## anatomy

* `src/gadget.hpp` exposes the gadget, which is an abstraction of related constraint
and witness behavior in a circuit. This gadget uses other gadgets, creates its own
constraints, and exposes an interface for building input maps.

* `src/snark.hpp` exposes a loose wrapper around the constraint system and
key generation used by `test.cpp` to construct proofs and verify them as necessary.
